## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This website utilizes an API. I first created an input and a button. In javascript I created a function called getAnimal for the purpose to get an image from the api. I made the input value equal to a variable. I then put the variable I created into the rand parameter section of the api url. Then I created the fetch function and passed in the api url with the variable in the date parameter. Then I told it to give me a response in JSON, then I took that response and put it into a parameter called data. The data I got back from the JSON had a name, lifespan and image url key so I set them equal to different html tags to show on the website whenever someone put a animal name into the input.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that not every api takes in parameters or an api key.
